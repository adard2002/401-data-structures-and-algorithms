## Quick Sort
#### Steps of a Quick Sort array:
1. Set a pivot point
2. go through the array swapping values so that the greater values are pivotted to the right and the lower values are pivotted to the left counting from lowest to greatest.
3. After a full traversal swap the pivot into the middle of the two sides and it's sorted.
4. Call the left sided sort for the left side and same with the right side.
5. Calling it recursivevly will keep sorting smaller and smaller portions until the partion size goes down to 1.
