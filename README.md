# Unit Tests & Documentation
Write a function called insertShiftArray which takes in an array and the value to be added. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with the new value added at the middle index.

## Challenge
Insert a number in the center of an array of numbers

## Approach & Efficiency

# Binary search
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
Taking an array and splitting it into 2 sections over and over.

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Write a function called BinarySearch which takes in 2 parameters: a sorted array and the search key. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the index of the arrayâ€™s element that is equal to the search key, or -1 if the element does not exist.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
Binary Code Search Pseudo Code 
INPUT = Single Sorted Array and a Key
OUTPUT=  If found = 2/ else = -1
Start in Center of Array , 
if int = Key, Output =2
If int i < Key then Key.Length/2
if > 2 then Key.leng
2then end of array , search center
